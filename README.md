# Staking Contract

This is a Solidity smart contract that implements a staking mechanism for ERC20 tokens. Users can stake tokens to earn rewards based on the duration and amount of their stake. The contract is designed to be secure and efficient, utilizing OpenZeppelin libraries for access control, pausing, reentrancy protection, and safe token transfers. Also, only pre approved users can stake tokens in the contract.
This new version uses Hardhat as development framework.
